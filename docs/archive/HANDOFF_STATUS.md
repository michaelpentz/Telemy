## Notes

- Canonical contracts/specs remain in `docs/`.
- Add new dated handoff entries to `docs/archive/HANDOFF_HISTORY.md`.
- Update `docs/CURRENT_STATUS.md` when priorities or validated runtime state changes.
- If a handoff entry references repo-root dock bridge files (`aegis-dock-bridge.js`), verify they exist in the current checkout before treating that work as present.
